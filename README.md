# README

This repo is a place where I am practicing/experimenting with the following:

* Docs-as-code workflow to keep my docs-as-code skills fresh.
* GitHub Pages and static-site generators like Jekyll.
* Publishing creative writing to get used to having it out in the open, with my name attached. 

You can find my creative writing in these places:

* [Fiction](https://public.gwynnemonahan.com/site/fiction/)
* [writingClasses](https://public.gwynnemonahan.com/site/writingClasses/)
* [Creative Non-Fiction](https://public.gwynnemonahan.com/site/creativeNonFiction/)

The writing on [public.gwynnemonahan.com](https://public.gwynnemonahan.com) is not always polished; sometimes it's published for the sake of putting it out there. If I wait until it's perfect, it will remain an unseen, unknown file buried in a folder. This way, at least, I become accustomed to publishing stories with my name on them.

This is more the "good is better than perfect" repo than the "it must be perfect or else" repo.

If you're looking for my blog, you'll [find that here](https://www.gwynnemonahan.com).

Thank you for visiting.
