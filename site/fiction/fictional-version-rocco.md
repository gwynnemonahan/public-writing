It was hard to remember life without Rocco, but not impossible. The Prosecution still lingered, even if it was quiet, relegated to the background. There wasn't the space for the Prosecution with Rocco. 

Bally didn't have trouble remembering what life was like with the Prosecution, but her desire to recall that time was minimal. She found herself wondering, now, how she lived with the Prosecution for nearly 20 years. That constant voice chastizing her, critizing her, convincing her death was the best option. 

Rocco let out a sigh. 

She smiled, stroked his side, rubbed his ears just the way he liked.

"You're right," she said. "That was long ago. Before you."

It lingered, though. She still recalled, with clarity, the night things started to change. 

Rocco stood and took three steps to her left so he was at her side.

"What a beautiful dog," someone said from behind.

Bally stood and turned around. "Thank you," she said. Rocco didn't move.

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to surprise you. I haven't seen a malinois in quite some time. May I?" He knelt down.

Bally let Rocco apporach. He sniffed the man's hand, then leaned into it. The man gently stroked Rocco. "Such a beautiful dog." Rocco licked tears from the man's face, and leaned into him, almost knocking the man over. 

Bally watched, a smile twitching at the corners of her lips, a sense of pride at the work she put into Rocco for moments like this.

The man stood. "Thank you." He wiped tears from his eyes. "I'm sorry. I had a mal like this while deployed to Afghanistan. He died a few months ago now. Best dog."

Rocco whined.

"It's OK pal," the man said. "You've made this old man happy." He looked at Bally. "What's he traiined for?"

"Search and rescue," Bally said.

"Fantastic." The old man smiled broadly. "Well, enjoy the rest of your evening."

Rocco returned to Bally's side. "Thank you sir. You, too." 

The old man waved as he continued along the Sea Wall, a little spring in his step. Bally scratched Rocco behind his ears. "Good boy. We brought some joy to that man's life." She smiled. "It's what we do sometimes."
