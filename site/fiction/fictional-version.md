"Oh my dog. I'm fangirling right now."

She looked up from her book to see a woman standing on the otherside of the table. Big, gentle snowflakes fell outside, blanketing the runway. A line of planes waited for deicing.

"I read your book."

"Oh. Thank you," she said.

"May I?" The woman motioned to the chair.

She closed her book, and motioned for the woman to sit.

"I'm Jeanne by the way," the woman said, extending her hand.

"Nice to meet you Jeanne," she said, shaking Jeanne's hand.

"I don't normally do this."

She had become accustomed to this by now. People coming up to her, wanting a selfie, an autograph, something to memoralize the moment for them. Usually after readings, or a talk. This was a first though.

"I have a daughter, had a daughter. Your book reminded me of her." Emotion caught in Jeanne's voice. "Part of me wished she had lived long enough to have read it. Part of me is grateful I found your book when I did." Jeanne took a breath. "I've taught it to my students the last four years and it has helped some of them, too."

This was also a first. 

"I saw you sitting here, and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to tell you in person."

"Thank you. I appreciate that. I take it your a teacher?"

Jeanne smiled. "Yes. I teach English and psychology at a local community college."

"Jeanne? Where did you go?"

She froze.

Jeanne waved her hand. "Over here!"

She knew that voice. That soft, gentle timber. She didn't need to see his face.

Jeanne stood and hugged him, then turned to her. "Stanley, this is Bally. She wrote the book."

Their eyes met. He smiled, extended his hand in greeting. "Hello. Nice to meet you. Pardon my wife."

"Oh stop," Jeanne said, laughing. 

She stood, took his hand, shook it. "Stanley."

Jeanne looked at them. Her eyes got wide. Her mouth dropped open. A sound escaped. "Oh my dog." A hand went to cover her mouth as she looked from Stanley to Bally. She squealed. "No way! Is he?" She turns to Stanley. "Are you? Oh my dog. How did I not see that!"

She felt heat in her cheeks, moisture on her palms. Her eyes instinctively went to the floor. 

"Oh dear. Oh I'm sorry. I'm majorly fangirling and its making your uncomfortable." Jeanne took a breath, sat back down, and motioned for Stanley to sit next to her. "I've invaded something."

Bally chuckled as she sat back down. "No no. It's OK." She smiled. "There's probably a reason for this that will make itself known at some point in the future."

Stanley smiled awkwardly. He looked at his watch. "We should be going."

Bally nodded and started to open the book she had been reading. She looked out the window. "Yeah, weather looks bad. Drive safe."

"Where are you headed?" Jeanne asked.

"I was headed to Chicago, but," she motioned out the window. "Mother Nature had other plans, so I'll hang out for the night, see if I can catch the first flight out tomorrow."

"Don't be silly," Jeanne said.
