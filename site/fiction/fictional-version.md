"This is my brother, Stanley," Jeanne said. "This is Bally."

Bally gave a hand motion to Rocco as she looked at Stanely. It had been ten years, maybe more. 

"She's stranded so I invited her to stay the night with us."

They both looked at Jeanne.

"No, thank you," Bally said. "That's very kind, but Rocco and I"

"Stanely," Jeanne said.

"There's plenty of room. I don't have pets."

"Again, thank you, that is very kind but we"

"And he owns so there isn't a pet policy or some kind of other nonsense to clear it," Jeanne said. "Do you have all your luggage?"

Rocco let out a gentle whine. "I need to walk him."

"Oh goodness, yes. We'll wait at baggae carousel 3."

Bally nodded and started walking. Rocco followed. They went out the sliding doors, and found a dog area. Rocco sniffed until he found his spot, and relieved himself. 

"I don't know what to do Rocco," Bally said. "It's been ten years, at least, yet I still feel this would violate some doctor-patient rule or something. But also, every hotel I've checked so far is booked. So I guess our options are either stay in the airport, or accept her invite." She looked down at Rocco. "What do you think." Rocco touched her knee with his nose twice. She sighed, gave him a scratch behind his left ear. "OK. We'll accept."

They went back inside, and found Jeanne and Stanley waiting at Baggage Carousel 3. Jeanne was smiling.

"Got everything?" Jeanne asked.

"Yes," Bally said. 

"Does Rocco eat steak?"

Bally chuckled. She looked at Rocco. "Yes."

"Perfect."

"Steak?" Stanley asked.

"Dinner, brother. Dinner. I don't know about you Bally, but I'm famished." She picked up her two bags, put one on her back, one on her front, and slung her carry on over her shoulder. "I haven't eaten a steak in three months."

Stanley laughed. "Steak it is then. I'll swing by the corner store." He looked at Bally. "There's a nice park just not far from me."

"Kits! Oh my God. Kits Beach. How I've missed that place," Jeanne said. "It's a great park. You and Rocco can get a good walk in while we make dinner."

Kits Beach. Bally swallowed. "Great. And thank you, again. I'll do the dishes."

"Pshaw. Nope. You and Rocco get the night off," Jeanne said. She looked down at Rocco. "Nothing short of amazing the work you two do." <!-- Rocco is a search and resuce dog>

"Thank you," Bally said. 

They walked to Stanley's car, and put their bags in the back. Bally took out Rocco's car harness, got him situated, then climbed in and sat next to him. She listened to Leanne talk about her three months in small African countries, providing aid, education, and training. Her eyes felt heavy, but her mind remained in overdrive. Rocco shifted, and rested his head in her lap. She smiled at him, and stroked his head.


<!--
Bally sat at a table near the window, watching the snow fall. It was well past the departure time. By hour three, she had figured the flight would be canceled. It took them until hour five to cancel the flight. Some kind of mechanical issue. There were no other flights leaving for her destination tonight. 

She opened her book back up, and returned to reading. Her eyes read the words, but her mind drifted through the myriad of flight delays she had experienced. The thunderstorm that spawned tornadoes while she was on her way back from Nashville. The blizzard on her way to San Francisco that delayed the flight four hours, and got her into San Jose instead at 3 in the morning. The terrible head cold that had started during the delay, progressed for the cross-country flight, and settled into misery for that week.

She looked at her watch. It was almost 10pm. She looked down at Rocco, sitting quietly at her feet, his muzzle on her toes. 

"Whatcha think bud?"

Rocco lifted his head.

"I know buddy."

Bally pulled out her phone, thought for moment, remembering what country she's in, and opened an app. She set the search critiera to dog-friendly, and hoped there was one hotel with a room available for them tonight.

Rocco let out a low grow. She looked up. 

A man in security uniform stopped. "Excuse me," he said. "This side is closing for the night."

"Ah, OK. Thank you. We'll move," she said as she put her phone away and stood up. Rocco kept his gaze on the man in the security uniform. "Easy," she said. "Thank you officer." She slung her bag over her shoulder, and turned. Rocco followed. 

They made their way through the terminal, and then out through security. She found an empty bench, and sat back down. She gave a hand motion, and Rocco resumed his place at her feet, muzzle resting on her toes. She took out her phone again.

"Isn't that?" 

Rocco let out a low growl again. Bally looked up. 

"Excuse me. Hi," a woman said as she stood a few feet away. "Are you...are you Bally?"

Bally didn't answer.

"I'm sorry. I'm Leanne. I recognized the hat from photo on the jacket. Of your book. I read your book."

Bally tapped Rocco on the side to relax, and stood. "Yes, I'm Bally." She extended her hand in greeting. "Nice to meet you Leanne. And thank you for reading my book."

"Who is this," Leanne asked, maintaining eye contact with Bally.

"This is Rocco," Bally said as she looked down at him. Rocco sat up. "Do you want to meet him," Bally asked, returning her gaze to Leanne.

"Yes."

"Say hello," Bally said to Rocco. Rocco walked to Leanne, walked around, and leaned against her. "You can pet him."

Leanne put a hand on Rocco's side, and stroked him. "He's beautiful."

"Thank you. You can kneel and pet him if you want. He loves it when people scratch his left hip, or between his ears."

Leanne kneeled and found the spots. Rocco wiggled with excitement, pushing himself into Leanne. Leanne laughed. Bally watched, smiling. It had taken hard work to get to this kind of interaction. 

"Oh my dog. I'm fangirling right now."

She looked up from her book to see a woman standing on the otherside of the table. Big, gentle snowflakes fell outside, blanketing the runway. A line of planes waited for deicing.

"I read your book."

"Oh. Thank you," she said.

"May I?" The woman motioned to the chair.

She closed her book, and motioned for the woman to sit.

"I'm Jeanne by the way," the woman said, extending her hand.

"Nice to meet you Jeanne," she said, shaking Jeanne's hand.

"I don't normally do this."

She had become accustomed to this by now. People coming up to her, wanting a selfie, an autograph, something to memoralize the moment for them. Usually after readings, or a talk. This was a first though.

"I have a daughter, had a daughter. Your book reminded me of her." Emotion caught in Jeanne's voice. "Part of me wished she had lived long enough to have read it. Part of me is grateful I found your book when I did." Jeanne took a breath. "I've taught it to my students the last four years and it has helped some of them, too."

This was also a first. 

"I saw you sitting here, and wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to tell you in person."

"Thank you. I appreciate that. I take it your a teacher?"

Jeanne smiled. "Yes. I teach English and psychology at a local community college."

"Jeanne? Where did you go?"

She froze.

Jeanne waved her hand. "Over here!"

She knew that voice. That soft, gentle timber. She didn't need to see his face.

Jeanne stood and hugged him, then turned to her. "Stanley, this is Bally. She wrote the book."

Their eyes met. He smiled, extended his hand in greeting. "Hello. Nice to meet you. Pardon my wife."

"Oh stop," Jeanne said, laughing. 

She stood, took his hand, shook it. "Stanley."

Jeanne looked at them. Her eyes got wide. Her mouth dropped open. A sound escaped. "Oh my dog." A hand went to cover her mouth as she looked from Stanley to Bally. She squealed. "No way! Is he?" She turns to Stanley. "Are you? Oh my dog. How did I not see that!"

She felt heat in her cheeks, moisture on her palms. Her eyes instinctively went to the floor. 

"Oh dear. Oh I'm sorry. I'm majorly fangirling and its making your uncomfortable." Jeanne took a breath, sat back down, and motioned for Stanley to sit next to her. "I've invaded something."

Bally chuckled as she sat back down. "No no. It's OK." She smiled. "There's probably a reason for this that will make itself known at some point in the future."

Stanley smiled awkwardly. He looked at his watch. "We should be going."

Bally nodded and started to open the book she had been reading. She looked out the window. "Yeah, weather looks bad. Drive safe."

"Where are you headed?" Jeanne asked.

"I was headed to Chicago, but," she motioned out the window. "Mother Nature had other plans, so I'll hang out for the night, see if I can catch the first flight out tomorrow."

"Don't be silly," Jeanne said.
