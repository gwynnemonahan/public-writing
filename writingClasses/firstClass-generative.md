## Generative Writing 10/30/2025

The most vivid memory, thing that impacted us the most that we want to write about. That impacted me the most that I want to write about. 

First thing that comes to mind is Riley. Adopting Riley. From there it goes back to buying my first house, and forward to where I am today. Like an accordian. I often think my brain is like an accordian, expanding and contracting, pushing out notes and tunes in the form of words and phrases that maybe someone will understand. Like I'm constantlly trying to find the right tune, the right set of notes ot be understood. Maybe Riley is how that happened. How my brain was able to finally land on the tune to share, and the connections that have been made since. Dog trainers. Hiking. The complete change or about face of my internal conversation. The way my brain processes the firehose of inputs on daily basis now. Its ability to recognize aspects that were invisible before. When my thoughts are racing. When I'm too focused on something I can't control. It recognizes, toggles to give space, and resets itself. Apps are still running in the background. Processes are still there. THe configuration has been adjusted though. Some apps are put to sleep. Some are deleted. Sometimes ones deleted must be reinstalled. Upgrades happen more often it seems. More along the lines of continuos deliverly and continuious improvement.

Software development seems to be how I explain things. Perhaps even how I process.
